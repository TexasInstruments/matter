The TI GitHub for Matter repository contains all the software development tools
that enable engineers to develop a Matter accessory device and is the starting
point for Matter development on all SimpleLink™ Thread and Wi-Fi® devices. It
contains documentation, examples, build scripts and device support. For more
details on TI technology for the Matter standard, refer to
[our Matter overview](https://ti.com/matter).

Matter is an application layer developed by the Connectivity Standards Alliance
(CSA), formerly the Zigbee Alliance. It runs on the IP-based Thread and Wi-Fi
network layers and can use Bluetooth® Low Energy for commissioning, allowing
devices from different ecosystems to communicate even if they are manufactured
by different brands. For more details on Matter, please refer to
[Matter Readme](./README_MATTER.md).
