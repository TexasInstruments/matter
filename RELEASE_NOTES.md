# Release Information

The SimpleLink™ Matter links to the Texas Instruments GitHub repository that
contains all the software development tools that enable engineers to develop
Matter Accessory Device and is the starting point for Matter development on all
SimpleLink CC13xx and CC26xx family of wireless microcontrollers (MCUs). It
contains essential software components, such as a Bluetooth® Low Energy (BLE)
protocol stack supporting Bluetooth 5.2, Thread 1.3 networking stack based on
OpenThread and Matter 1.0 application layer stack based on open source Matter
stack. In addition, the Dynamic Multi-Protocol Manager (DMM) software component
enables multiprotocol development on a single SimpleLink wireless MCU.

The SimpleLink MCU portfolio offers a single development environment that
delivers flexible hardware, software, and tool options for customers developing
wired and wireless applications. With 100 percent code reuse across host MCUs,
Wi-Fi™, Bluetooth Low Energy, 2.4GHz, Sub-1GHz devices and more, choose the MCU
or connectivity standard that fits your design. A one-time investment with the
SimpleLink software development kit allows you to reuse often, opening the door
to create unlimited applications. For more information, visit
